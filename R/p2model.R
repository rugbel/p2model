#' p2model: A package for fitting p2 models
#'
#' The \code{p2model} package can be used to estimate the parameters of a p2 model
#' for directed binary networks with correlated random effects. It implements
#' (approximate) maximum likelihood estimation, following the methodology
#' studied in Bellio and Soriani (2019).
#'
#' A vignette is available with some illustrative examples.
